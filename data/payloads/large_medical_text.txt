Medical Report - MRI Brain Scan (Extended Clinical Data)

Patient ID: MRI_DEMO_001
Date: 2025-10-21
Modality: T1-weighted MRI
Institution: Advanced Medical Imaging Center
Radiologist: Dr. Maria Rodriguez, MD

CLINICAL INDICATION:
Routine follow-up examination for chronic headaches
Previous imaging comparison required
Patient history: 45-year-old female with recurrent migraines

TECHNIQUE:
T1-weighted sagittal, axial, and coronal images were obtained
Slice thickness: 5mm with 1mm gap
Field of view: 240mm x 240mm
Matrix: 512 x 512
TR/TE: 500/15 ms

FINDINGS:
The brain parenchyma demonstrates normal signal intensity throughout.
No evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or mass effect.
Ventricular system is within normal limits for patient age.
No midline shift is identified.
Gray-white matter differentiation is preserved.
No abnormal enhancement following contrast administration.
Cerebellopontine angles are clear bilaterally.
Internal auditory canals are symmetric and unremarkable.

COMPARISON:
Compared to prior study dated 2024-08-15:
- No significant interval change identified
- Stable appearance of brain parenchyma
- No new lesions detected

IMPRESSION:
Normal MRI brain examination.
No acute intracranial abnormality.
Findings stable compared to prior examination.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Continue clinical correlation as indicated
Follow-up imaging as clinically warranted
Patient counseling regarding normal findings
